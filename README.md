## How To Play

### Glossary

#### Match

A match is the all emcompassing word with all other words inside it. When you sit down with three other people, 
you start a match. When the score reaches 11 (or whatever you'd like), the match is over. You can play again and
have a best of 3 series of matches perhaps, but ye shall not use the word game for this instance. Maybe later
once you are a pro and know everything you can let it slip, but for now, no way!

#### Round

Inside a match is a number of rounds. At the beginning of a round, the cards are dealt, bids are made, and one bid
is accepted. At the end of each round, points are tallied and added to the total score.

#### Trick

Inside each round there is a number of tricks equal to the number of cards in each player's hand (usually 6).
In each trick, someone leads with a card, and each player, going in clockwise motion, plays a card following the
necessary rules. At the end of the trick, someone wins the trick and takes all the cards for his or her team. That
person leads the next trick.
